### General Questions

<Accordion title="What is TAC?">
TAC is a Layer 1 blockchain with a novel TON Adapter technology, specifically designed to enable Ethereum developers to deploy their existing applications and reach TON and Telegram's 1 billion user base. TAC allows EVM dApps to operate as hybrid applications that can be accessed directly through TON wallets.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does TAC differ from other blockchain solutions?">
Unlike traditional bridges or sidechains, TAC is a full Layer 1 that focuses on creating hybrid dApps through its TON Adapter technology. TAC doesn't just connect chains; it enables true interoperability where users can interact with EVM applications directly from their TON wallets, with no need to manage multiple wallets or bridge tokens manually. TAC maintains EVM's full functionality while providing seamless access from TON.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What problem does TAC solve?">
TAC solves the disconnection between Ethereum's rich dApp ecosystem and TON's massive user base on Telegram. EVM developers struggle to reach TON's users because rebuilding their applications in TON's native language (FunC) is time-consuming and requires extensive reauditing. TAC bridges this gap by allowing existing EVM code to be deployed as-is while making it accessible to TON users.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Who is TAC designed for?">
TAC is primarily designed for EVM developers and projects that want to expand their reach to TON's ecosystem and Telegram's 1 billion users without rewriting their code or creating separate applications. It's ideal for DeFi protocols, gaming platforms, NFT marketplaces, and other dApps that want to leverage their existing Solidity codebase while tapping into TON's growing user base.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is TAC its own blockchain or an extension of TON?">
TAC is its own Layer 1 blockchain built with Cosmos SDK and Ethermint that creates a unique connection to TON through the TON Adapter. While TAC expands TON's capabilities by bringing EVM compatibility to the ecosystem, it maintains its own validators, consensus mechanism, and blockchain infrastructure. This design allows TAC to offer full EVM compatibility while facilitating seamless interaction with TON.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does TAC stand for?">
TAC is not an acronym. It doesn't stand for anything. 
</Accordion>

### Technical Questions

<Accordion title="How does the TON Adapter work?">
The TON Adapter is a decentralized message routing system that securely connects TON and TAC's EVM Layer. When a TON user interacts with a hybrid dApp, the TON Adapter receives the transaction, processes it through a network of sequencers that validate the message, creates Merkle trees for consensus, and then executes the corresponding action on the EVM side. The entire process is secured through a multi-layer validation system with economic incentives to ensure reliable operation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is a hybrid dApp in the context of TAC?">
A hybrid dApp in TAC's context is an application that has its core logic written in Solidity and deployed on TAC's EVM Layer, but can be directly accessed and used through TON wallets. The user interacts with the application on TON, but the complex application logic runs on the EVM side through the TON Adapter. This allows developers to build applications that leverage EVM's mature ecosystem while providing a native experience for TON users.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is TAC fully EVM-compatible?">
Yes, TAC is fully EVM-compatible. It's built on Cosmos SDK with Ethermint, which provides complete EVM equivalence. This means Solidity developers can deploy their existing smart contracts without modifications, using familiar tools like Hardhat, Truffle, or Remix. All EVM opcodes, features, and paradigms are supported, including complex DeFi primitives like flash loans and composable contracts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How are transactions processed between TON and TAC?">
When a user on TON initiates a transaction for an EVM dApp, it follows these steps:
1. The transaction is sent to a proxy contract on TON
2. The TON Adapter's sequencer network detects and validates the transaction
3. Sequencers form Merkle trees and reach consensus on the transaction validity
4. The validated transaction is executed on TAC's EVM Layer
5. Results are communicated back to TON via the same sequencer network
6. The user receives confirmation and any returned assets on TON
This process ensures secure, validated communication between the two chains.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does TAC handle token transfers between chains?">
TAC manages token transfers through a lock-and-mint/burn-and-release mechanism:
1. When sending tokens from TON to TAC, the tokens are locked in the TON Adapter on TON, and equivalent tokens are minted on TAC
2. When sending tokens from TAC to TON, the tokens are burned on TAC, and the original tokens are unlocked on TON
3. The entire process is handled by the sequencer network, which ensures the correct amount of tokens are locked/unlocked and minted/burned
4. Token metadata is preserved across chains, with TON jettons represented as ERC20 tokens on TAC
This system maintains asset security and proper supply across both chains.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What security measures does TAC implement?">
TAC implements a multi-layer security approach:
1. TAC's EVM Layer is secured through Delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS) with Tendermint consensus
2. Additional security through Babylon Bitcoin Staking, which adds Bitcoin's economic security
3. The TON Adapter is secured by a decentralized sequencer network with economic stake
4. Sequencers are organized into groups that require 66% internal consensus
5. Cross-group validation adds another layer of security
6. Economic penalties for malicious or incorrect behavior
7. Comprehensive message validation ensures transaction integrity
This layered approach creates robust security for both the blockchain and cross-chain operations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does TAC handle failed transactions?">
When a transaction fails on either chain, TAC has built-in mechanisms to ensure assets remain secure:
1. If execution fails, assets are automatically returned to the sender
2. The system prevents forwarding of failed messages to the target chain
3. A specialized rollback process collects failed transactions into new Merkle trees
4. These trees are processed to properly resolve the failed operations and return assets
5. Users receive notifications of the failure through their wallet or the dApp interface
This ensures that even in failure cases, user assets remain protected.
</Accordion>

### Development Questions
<Accordion title="How do I deploy my existing Solidity contracts to TAC?">
Deploying Solidity contracts to TAC follows the same process as Ethereum:
1. Set up your development environment with tools like Hardhat, Truffle, or Remix
2. Configure your project to connect to TAC's RPC endpoints
3. Deploy your contracts using standard deployment scripts
4. Verify your contracts on TAC's block explorer
No code modifications are needed as TAC provides full EVM compatibility. You can use all the standard Ethereum development tools and workflows you're already familiar with.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What tools are available for building on TAC?">
TAC supports all standard Ethereum development tools plus specialized tools for hybrid dApp development:
1. Standard EVM tools: Hardhat, Truffle, Remix, Web3.js, Ethers.js
2. TAC SDK: JavaScript library for creating hybrid dApps
3. Proxy contract generators: Tools to create and deploy proxy contracts on TON like TAC Developer Console. 
4. Testing frameworks: Including TAC-specific testing utilities
5. Block explorers: For monitoring transactions on both chains
6. Frontend libraries: Extensions to standard libraries for TON wallet integration
These tools make it easy for EVM developers to leverage their existing skills while building for TAC.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I integrate TON wallet support in my dApp?">
Integrating TON wallet support involves these steps:
1. Install the TAC SDK: `npm install tac-sdk`
2. Add TON Connect for wallet connections: `npm install @tonconnect/ui`
3. Initialize the TAC SDK in your frontend code
4. Create proxy messages for your EVM contract methods
5. Use the SDK to send transactions through TON wallets to your EVM contract
The TAC SDK handles all the complexity of cross-chain messaging, making the integration process straightforward for developers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I track cross-chain transactions?">
The TAC SDK provides tools for tracking cross-chain transactions:
1. Use the TransactionStatus class from the SDK
2. Get the operationId from a transaction using getOperationId()
3. Check the current status with getStatusTransaction()
4. Monitor status progression through: EVMMerkleMessageCollected > EVMMerkleRootSet > EVMMerkleMessageExecuted > TVMMerkleMessageCollected > TVMMerkleRootSet > TVMMerkleMessageExecuted
5. Use simplified status tracking with getSimpifiedTransactionStatus() which returns Pending, Successful, Failed, or OperationIdNotFound
This allows developers to provide real-time updates to users about their cross-chain transactions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are there any limitations when building hybrid dApps?">
While TAC strives to provide full compatibility, there are some considerations:
1. Cross-chain latency: Transactions between chains have higher latency than single-chain transactions
2. Message size limits: There are limits to how much data can be sent in a single cross-chain message
4. TON-specific UX considerations: Hybrid dApps should be designed with TON wallet UX in mind
5. Token decimal differences: TON tokens typically use 9 decimals compared to EVM's 18 decimals

These limitations can be addressed through proper application design and architecture.
