TAC provides comprehensive API access through two complementary sets of endpoints: standard EVM JSON-RPC APIs for full Ethereum compatibility, and TAC-specific APIs for cross-chain functionality.

This dual approach ensures that existing Ethereum tools work seamlessly while providing access to TAC's unique hybrid dApp capabilities.
