Proxy Apps handle all cross-chain complexities while providing a native experience for users.

## Understanding Proxy Apps

A Proxy App is a lightweight smart contract that processes calls between different parts of the TAC system. On EVM (TAC EVM Layer), it manages interactions between the execution layer and the target application.

When you want to interact with an EVM application through TAC, you don't need to understand the underlying cross-chain mechanics. The Proxy Apps handle all the necessary translations and communications automatically.

## How Proxy Apps Work

The proxy system operates on both chains:

### TON Side Proxy

On the TON chain, the Proxy App receives your TON transaction and prepares it for the TON Adapter (on EVM side). When you interact with an EVM application, the TON proxy:

1. Accepts your transaction from your TON wallet
2. Formats the call data appropriately
3. Locks any required assets in the Adapter wallet
4. Sends the formatted message to the sequencer network
5. Monitors transaction status and handles confirmations

### EVM Side Proxy

The EVM proxy connects TAC and the target application:

1. Receives verified messages from the sequencer network
2. Handles asset unlocking or minting
3. Interacts with the target EVM application
4. Processes return data
5. Sends results back through the TON Adapter

## Message Flow

When you interact with an EVM application through TAC, here's what happens:

<Steps>
<Step title="Transaction Initiation">
You send a transaction using your TON wallet to TON Adapter. The proxy formats your request and prepares any assets for transfer through the sequencer network.
</Step>

<Step title="Message Transfer">
The TON proxy creates a message containing your transaction details and sends it through the sequencer network, where sequencers validate and process it.
</Step>

<Step title="EVM Execution">
The EVM proxy receives the validated message, processes any required asset operations, and calls the target application with your requested action.
</Step>

<Step title="Return Trip">
Results from the EVM application flow back through the same path in reverse, eventually reaching your TON wallet.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Asset Handling

Proxy Apps manage asset transfers securely between chains:

### Asset Locking

When sending assets from TON to EVM, the TON proxy locks them in the TON Adapter. This ensures assets can't be double-spent and maintains the correct token supply across chains.

### Asset Minting and Unlocking

The EVM proxy handles asset representation on the EVM side. It can mint new tokens representing locked TON assets or unlock previously transferred tokens, depending on the direction of transfer.

## Security Considerations

Proxy Apps incorporate several security measures:

### Asset Validation

The TON proxy verifies that the actual assets transferred match the transaction parameters. This prevents potential exploits where someone might try to claim they've transferred more assets than they actually have.

### Transaction Verification

Before executing any operations, the EVM proxy validates that the transaction has been properly approved by the sequencer network through TAC's consensus mechanism.

### Failure Handling

If a transaction fails at any point, Proxy Apps ensure assets are returned to their owners. The rollback process is automatic and secure, protecting users from losing funds due to failed transactions.

## For Developers

### Testing

Before deploying to mainnet, test your integration using our testnet:

1. Deploy your application to TAC EVM testnet (Turin)
2. Build the Proxy App
3. Test interactions using test tokens
4. Verify both TON and EVM side behavior

## Common Use Cases

### Token Swaps

Users can swap tokens on EVM DEXs directly from their TON wallet. The Proxy Apps handle all the necessary asset locking, unlocking, and message routing automatically.

### NFT Markets

<Info>
  TAC doesn't support NFTs yet, but it is on our roadmap, and we will support it
  soon.
</Info>

Browse and purchase TON NFTs on EVM marketplaces using TON currency. Proxy Apps manage the currency conversion and NFT transfer process seamlessly.

### DeFi Integration

Access EVM DeFi protocols through your TON wallet. Proxy Apps translate your actions into the appropriate protocol interactions on the EVM side.
