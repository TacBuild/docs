Proxy contracts handles all cross-chain complexities while providing a native experience for users. On EVM, Proxy contracts are written in Solidity and deployed on the TAC EVM Layer. On TON, everything is handled by TAC SDK. **You don't need to build your own proxy on TON side**.

## Understanding proxy contracts

A proxy contract is a lightweight smart contract that processes calls between different parts of the TAC system. On EVM (TAC EVM Layer), it manages interactions between the execution layer and the target application.



When you want to interact with an EVM application through TAC, you don't need to understand the underlying cross-chain mechanics. The proxy contracts handle all the necessary translations and communications automatically.

## How Proxy Contracts Work

The proxy system operates on both EVM and TON chains:

### TON Side Proxy

On the TON chain, the proxy app receives your TON transaction and prepares it for the TON Adapter (on EVM side). When you interact with an EVM application, the TON proxy:

1. Accepts your transaction from your TON wallet
2. Formats the call data appropriately
3. Locks any required assets in the Adapter wallet
4. Sends the formatted message to the sequencer network
5. Monitors transaction status and handles confirmations

<Warning>
  Everything on TON side is handled by TAC SDK. You don't need to build your own proxy on TON side.
</Warning>

### EVM Side Proxy

The EVM proxy connects TAC and the target application:

1. Receives verified messages from the sequencer network
2. Handles asset unlocking or minting
3. Interacts with the target EVM application
4. Processes return data
5. Sends results back through the TON Adapter

## Message Flow

When you interact with an EVM application through TAC, here's what happens:

<Steps>
<Step title="Transaction Initiation">
You send a transaction using your TON wallet to TON Adapter. The proxy formats your request and prepares any assets for transfer through the sequencer network.
</Step>

<Step title="Message Transfer">
  The TON proxy creates a message containing your transaction details and sends
  it through the sequencer network, where sequencers validate and process it.
</Step>

<Step title="EVM Execution">
  The EVM proxy receives the validated message, processes any required asset
  operations, and calls the target application with your requested action.
</Step>

<Step title="Return Trip">
Results from the EVM application flow back through the same path in reverse, eventually reaching your TON wallet.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Asset Handling

Proxy contracts manage asset transfers securely between chains:

### Asset Locking

When sending assets from TON to EVM, the TON proxy locks them in the TON Adapter. This ensures assets can't be double-spent and maintains the correct token supply across chains.

### Asset Minting and Unlocking

The EVM proxy handles asset representation on the EVM side. It can mint new tokens representing locked TON assets or unlock previously transferred tokens, depending on the direction of transfer.

## Security Considerations

Proxy contracts incorporate several security measures:

### Asset Validation

The TON proxy verifies that the actual assets transferred match the transaction parameters. This prevents potential exploits where someone might try to claim they've transferred more assets than they actually have.

### Transaction Verification

Before executing any operations, the EVM proxy validates that the transaction has been properly approved by the sequencer network through TAC's consensus mechanism.

### Failure Handling

If a transaction fails at any point, proxy contracts ensure assets are returned to their owners. The rollback process is automatic and secure, protecting users from losing funds due to failed transactions.
