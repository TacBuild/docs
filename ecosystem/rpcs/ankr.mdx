Ankr is a leading provider of blockchain infrastructure, offering a range of services including RPC nodes, indexing, and analytics.

## TAC Network RPC Infrastructure

TAC offers full EVM compatibility through its Layer 1 blockchain. For reliable development and production environments, we've partnered with Ankr to provide enterprise-grade RPC infrastructure.

## Official Ankr RPC Endpoints

As our main RPC provider, Ankr delivers high-availability infrastructure specifically optimized for TAC Network:

| Type     | Network     | Endpoint                     |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| JSON-RPC | Mainnet     | https://rpc.ankr.com/tac     |
| JSON-RPC | SPB Testnet | https://rpc.ankr.com/tac_spb |

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose Your Integration Method">

The TAC Network supports multiple access methods:

- EVM JSON-RPC: For standard Ethereum-compatible development
- Tendermint: Direct access to the consensus layer
- Cosmos REST/gRPC: For Cosmos SDK-based interactions

</Step>

<Step title="Configure Your Application">

For EVM application integration using Ankr's RPC services:

```
// Example configuration with ethers.js
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// Connect via Ankr's RPC endpoint
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://spb.rpc.tac.build');

// Test connection
async function checkConnection() {
  const blockNumber = await provider.getBlockNumber();
  console.log(`Connected to TAC network at block: ${blockNumber}`);
}
```

Or for deployment on TAC L1 using Foundry

```
forge create --rpc-url https://spb.rpc.tac.build --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE YOUR_CONTRACT --legacy --broadcast
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Your Integration

Before production deployment:

- Get testnet tokens from the [TAC Faucet](https://spb.faucet.tac.build)
- Test transactions through Ankr's RPC endpoints
- Monitor performance via the Explorer
