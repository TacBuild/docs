## Why eOracle?

eOracle delivers high-stakes data through a decentralized, modular system purpose-built for security and reliability. Our network of 140+ validators, backed by over $2M in restaked ETH, ensures data integrity with real-time performance monitoring and advanced outlier detection. Each price update follows a transparent process: operators submit signed data to our proof-of-stake chain, reach consensus, and cryptographically broadcast the result to target chains. Trusted by leading curators and money markets, eOracle powers price feeds across 25+ chains, enabling liquidity for RWAs, PT tokens, LP tokens, synthetic assets, and novel stablecoins.

## ePrice – Modular Oracle for Asset Price Feeds\*\*

ePrice is built on restaked Ethereum security and combines reliable infrastructure with sophisticated price discovery. It supports permissionless integration, enabling accurate and secure pricing for a wide range of assets, including low-liquidity and emerging markets.

## PT Token Pricing

PT tokens offer fixed yield with a known maturity value, making them attractive as collateral. However, they require precise pricing to avoid bad debt and ensure market efficiency. eOracle provides the Defi Ecosystem with secure PT token feeds that support safer borrowing, more accurate risk-adjusted rates, and better capital utilization—enabling PT-backed markets to scale reliably.

## RWAfi Feeds

eOracle supports real-world asset (RWAfi) markets with verified price feeds for tokenized off-chain financial instruments, such as treasuries. These feeds bridge the gap between traditional finance and DeFi, enabling safe use of RWAs as collateral. Accurate, secure pricing is essential to unlock the full potential of RWA-backed lending—and eOracle delivers exactly that.

## Live Data Feeds
