RedStone delivers frequently updated, reliable, and diverse data feeds for your dApp on TAC. RedStone is unique in many aspects, three notable ones are:

- The most gas-optimized oracle (make your dApp scalable)
- Unique price feeds (including LSTs, LRTs, RWAs and TAC-native assets)
- Modular Oracle Design allows for flexibility towards user needs

RedStone operates in two models Push and Pull both available on TAC.

## How to integrate [RedStone Push](https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/dapps/redstone-push/)?

The RedStone Push model ensures that data is pushed into onchain storage via a relayer. Dedicated to protocols designed for the traditional Push Oracles model, that want to have full control of the data source and update conditions (heartbeat and deviation threshold).

The onchain contracts in Push enable storing prices and getting them through a familiar interface (e.g. the Chainlink Aggregator). Push model is available on both TAC testnet & coming to mainnet in the future. You can find a list of available price feeds [here](https://app.redstone.finance/app/feeds/).

## How to integrate RedStone [Pull](https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/dapps/redstone-pull/)?

The RedStone Pull model allows your dApp to utilize data feeds delivered “on-demand”, only when the data is needed. Thanks to the implementation of the EVM-connector library and extending your Ethers.js, your dApp will be able to attach signed data packages with timestamps to call data of your users’ transactions.

In order to implement the Pull model you will need to do two things:

1. Adjust the Javascript code of your dApp to inject the additional payload with signed data feeds to call data of your users’ transactions (otherwise you will get smart contract errors).
2. Adjust your smart contracts to include the libraries responsible for data extraction from call data and signature verification.

Please see the specific steps and ready code samples in the [Docs](https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/introduction).
