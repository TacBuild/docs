## Getting Started

You can use APRO Data Push to connect your smart contracts to asset pricing data. These data feeds aggregate information from many independent APRO node operators. Each price feed has an on-chain address and functions that enable contracts to read real-time pricing data directly from that address.

This section explains the Data Push, where APRO pushes real-time data to your contracts, allowing for immediate access to pricing updates without requiring frequent manual requests. This approach optimizes performance by reducing on-chain calls and enhances efficiency for applications that need continuous updates.

You'll learn how to read Data Feeds and store the value on-chain using Solidity. The code for reading Data Feeds on Tac or other EVM-compatible blockchains remains consistent across different chains and data feed types. You can choose various types of feeds depending on your use case, but the request and response format stays the same. However, the answer's decimal length and expected value ranges might differ depending on the feed you are using.

## EVM Guides

This section provides essential guides for integrating APRO Price Feeds on EVM-compatible blockchains. Whether you're working with smart contracts or using APIs to fetch price data, these guides will help you implement APRO's oracle solutions effectively.

### Using Price Feed

Learn how to read price feeds on-chain with Solidity and off-chain using Web3.js. This guide walks you through setting up your RPC endpoint, selecting the right Price Feed contract address, and interacting with data feeds for real-time price updates.

The code for reading Data Push is the same across all EVM-compatible blockchains and price feed types. You choose different types of price feed for different uses, but the request and response format are the same. To read a price feed, specify the following variables:

- RPC endpoint URL: This determines which network your smart contracts will run on. You can use a node provider service or point to your own client. If you are using a Web3 wallet, it is already configured with the RPC endpoints for several networks and the [Remix IDE](https://remix-project.org/) will automatically detect them for you.

- Feed contract address: This determines which Price Feed your smart contract will read. Contract addresses are different for each network. You can find the available contract addresses on the following pages:
  [Price Feed Contract Addresses](#Price-Feed-Contract)

The examples in this document indicate these variables, but you can modify the examples to work on different networks and read different feeds.
This guide shows example code that reads Price Feed using the following languages:

#### Onchain consumer contracts

These code examples demonstrate how to deploy a consumer contract on-chain that reads a data feed and stores the value.

##### Solidity

To consume price data, your smart contract should reference AggregatorV3Interface, which defines the external functions implemented by Data Feeds.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

/**
 * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES HARDCODED
 * VALUES FOR CLARITY.
 * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES UN-AUDITED CODE.

 */

interface AggregatorV3Interface {

  function decimals() external view returns (uint8);
  function description() external view returns (string memory);
  function version() external view returns (uint256);

  // getRoundData and latestRoundData should both raise "No data present"
  // if they do not have data to report, instead of returning unset values
  // which could be misinterpreted as actual reported values.
  function getRoundData(uint80 _roundId)
    external
    view
    returns (
      uint80 roundId,
      int256 answer,
      uint256 startedAt,
      uint256 updatedAt,
      uint80 answeredInRound
    );
  function latestRoundData()
    external
    view
    returns (
      uint80 roundId,
      int256 answer,
      uint256 startedAt,
      uint256 updatedAt,
      uint80 answeredInRound
    );

}


contract DataConsumer {
    AggregatorV3Interface internal dataFeed;

    /**
     * Network: Tac testnet
     * Aggregator: BTC/USD
     * Address: 0xA840DA91be3f707E8774A04Fc9e346d236F5dbBD
     */
    constructor() {
        dataFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
            0xA840DA91be3f707E8774A04Fc9e346d236F5dbBD
        );
    }

    /**
     * Returns the latest answer.
     */
    function getDataFeedLatestAnswer() public view returns (int) {
        // prettier-ignore
        (
        /* uint80 roundId */,
        int256 answer,
        /*uint256 startedAt*/,
        /*uint256 timeStamp*/,
        /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
        ) = dataFeed.latestRoundData();
        return answer;
    }

    /**
     * Returns decimals.
     */
    function getDecimals() public view returns (uint8) {
        uint8 decimals = dataFeed.decimals();
        return decimals;
    }
}
```

The latestRoundData function returns five values representing information about the latest price data. See the Price Feed API Reference for more details.

#### Offchain reads using Web3.js

These code examples demonstrate how to read data feeds directly off-chain using Web3 packages for each language.

##### Javascript

This example uses [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.10.0/) to retrieve feed data from the BTC / USD feed on the Tac testnet.

```Javascript
/**
 * THIS IS EXAMPLE CODE THAT USES HARDCODED VALUES FOR CLARITY.

### Price Feed API Reference

A technical reference for using the AggregatorV3Interface to fetch price data. This guide explains how to retrieve feed details like round data, descriptions, and decimal precision, ensuring you can accurately integrate APRO Price Feeds into your dApps.

When you use price feed, retrieve the feeds through the AggregatorV3Interface and the proxy address.

#### AggregatorV3Interface

Import this interface to your contract and use it to run functions in the proxy contract. Create the interface object by pointing to the proxy address. For example, on Tac you could create the interface object in the constructor of your contract using the following example:

```solidity
/**
 * Network: Tac testnet
 * Data Feed: BTC/USD
 * Address: 0xA840DA91be3f707E8774A04Fc9e346d236F5dbBD
 */
constructor() {
  priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(0xA840DA91be3f707E8774A04Fc9e346d236F5dbBD);
}
```

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >0.8.0;


interface AggregatorV3Interface {

  function decimals() external view returns (uint8);
  function description() external view returns (string memory);
  function version() external view returns (uint256);

  // getRoundData and latestRoundData should both raise "No data present"
  // if they do not have data to report, instead of returning unset values
  // which could be misinterpreted as actual reported values.
  function getRoundData(uint80 _roundId)
    external
    view
    returns (
      uint80 roundId,
      int256 answer,
      uint256 startedAt,
      uint256 updatedAt,
      uint80 answeredInRound
    );

}
```
