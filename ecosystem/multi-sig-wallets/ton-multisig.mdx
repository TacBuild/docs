TON Multisig is a multi-signature wallet solution for the TON blockchain that requires multiple signatures to execute transactions. It uses TON's native smart contracts to provide secure shared custody.

## How it works

TON Multisig deploys a smart contract on TON that requires multiple signatures before executing transactions. You configure:

- **Signers**: Addresses that can sign transactions
- **Proposers**: Addresses that can propose new transactions
- **Threshold**: Number of signatures required for execution

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to multisig.ton.org">
    Open [multisig.ton.org](https://multisig.ton.org)
  </Step>

<Step title="Add signers">
  Click "Add signer" and input TON addresses that can sign transactions
</Step>

<Step title="Add proposers">
  Click "Add proposer" and input TON addresses that can propose transactions
</Step>

<Step title="Set threshold">
  Set the number of signatures required to execute transactions
</Step>

  <Step title="Create multisig">
    Click "Create" to deploy the multisig contract
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Ensure all signer and proposer addresses are accessible. Lost access to
  required keys can lock your funds.
</Note>

## Usage

Once deployed, your multisig works as follows:

1. **Proposer** submits a transaction proposal
2. Required number of **signers** approve the proposal
3. Transaction executes automatically once threshold is met

This provides secure shared custody for TON assets without requiring complex coordination between parties.
