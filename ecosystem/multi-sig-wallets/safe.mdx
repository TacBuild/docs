description: "Deploy secure multi-signature wallets on TAC with Safe's battle-tested smart contracts"
---

Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) is a multi-signature wallet that requires multiple signatures to execute transactions. Instead of one private key controlling funds, Safe requires M-of-N signatures from designated owners.

## How it works

Safe deploys a smart contract that acts as your wallet. You define:

- **Owners**: Addresses that can sign transactions
- **Threshold**: Number of signatures required (e.g., 2 of 3 owners)

When you want to send a transaction, enough owners must sign it before execution.

<Info>
  Safe deployment on TAC is provided by **Protofire**. Protofire is the official
  partner of the Safe Team.

## Features

- **Configurable thresholds**: Change owners and signature requirements
- **Spending limits**: Set daily limits for specific tokens
- **Transaction batching**: Execute multiple operations in one transaction
- **Module system**: Add custom logic through Safe modules
