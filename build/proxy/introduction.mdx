description: "TAC Proxy contracts receive cross-chain calls from TON users and execute EVM logic"
---

TAC Proxy contracts are Solidity contracts that enable TON users to interact with your EVM applications directly from their TON wallets. Instead of bridging tokens and switching networks, users can call your smart contract functions and receive results in a single transaction.

<Note>
  Think of TAC Proxies as API endpoints for TON users. Instead of HTTP requests, 
  TON users send blockchain transactions that trigger your EVM functions and get 
  processed results back automatically.

## What TAC Proxies Enable

TAC Proxies solve the cross-chain user experience problem by creating **direct connections** between TON users and EVM applications:

### Direct Function Calls
TON users can call your EVM contract functions directly from their TON wallets without switching networks or managing multiple wallets.

```solidity
contract SwapProxy is TacProxyV1 {
    function swap(bytes calldata tacHeader, bytes calldata arguments) 
        external 
        _onlyCrossChainLayer 
    {
        // TON user's swap request is processed here
        // Results automatically sent back to their TON wallet
    }
}
```

### Seamless Asset Bridging
Tokens are automatically bridged from TON to your contract before your function executes, then bridged back with the results.

### One Transaction Experience
What used to require multiple transactions across different chains now happens in a single TON transaction:

**Without TAC Proxies:**
1. Bridge tokens TON → EVM
2. Switch to MetaMask
3. Interact with your dApp
4. Bridge tokens back EVM → TON

**With TAC Proxies:**
1. Call your function from TON wallet ✨

## Real-World Use Cases

### DeFi Protocols
```solidity
// TON user supplies collateral and borrows in one transaction
function supplyAndBorrow(bytes calldata tacHeader, bytes calldata arguments) 
    external 
    _onlyCrossChainLayer 
{
    // Supply collateral to lending protocol
    // Borrow against it
    // Send borrowed tokens back to TON user
}
```

### NFT Marketplaces
```solidity
// TON user buys NFT with their TON assets
function buyNFT(bytes calldata tacHeader, bytes calldata arguments) 
    external 
    _onlyCrossChainLayer 
{
    // Process payment
    // Transfer NFT to TON user
}
```

### Gaming & Rewards
```solidity
// Player completes quest, receives tokens
function completeQuest(bytes calldata tacHeader, bytes calldata arguments) 
    external 
    _onlyCrossChainLayer 
{
    // Verify quest completion
    // Mint and send reward tokens back to player
}
```

## Key Benefits

- Single transaction for complex operations

**For Developers:**
- Same Solidity development experience
- Access to TON's large user base
- Existing EVM tools and infrastructure

**For Applications:**
- Tap into TON ecosystem without rebuilding
- Unified liquidity across chains
- Simplified user onboarding

  **New to cross-chain development?** TAC Proxies handle all the complexity 
  behind the scenes. You write standard Solidity contracts with a simple 
  function signature pattern - everything else is automated.
