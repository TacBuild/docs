title: Deploying to TAC EVM
description: Learn how to deploy your Solidity smart contracts to TAC EVM
---


This guide will walk you through the process of deploying your Solidity smart contracts to the TAC EVM Layer using Foundry. By the end, you'll have successfully deployed a contract that can interact with the TON ecosystem through the TON Adapter.
<Note>
  TAC provides a standard EVM environment, allowing you to use modern tools like Foundry for smart contract development and deployment.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- An Ethereum wallet with private key
- Basic familiarity with Solidity and smart contract development
- Some TAC tokens for gas fees (available from the testnet faucet for testing)

## Step 1: Install Foundry
If you haven't already installed Foundry, start by setting it up on your system.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Foundry">
    ```bash
    curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    ```

    After the installation script completes, run:

```bash
foundryup
```
</Step>
  <Step title="Verify installation">
    ```bash
    forge --version
    ```

    You should see version information for forge, cast, and anvil.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Create a New Foundry Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize a new Foundry project">
    ```bash
    forge init tac-foundry-demo
    cd tac-foundry-demo
    ```

This creates a new Foundry project with a basic structure.
</Step>
  <Step title="Explore the project structure">
    Foundry creates several directories:

- `src/`: Directory for your smart contracts
- `test/`: Directory for your tests
- `script/`: Directory for deployment scripts
- `lib/`: Directory for dependencies
- `foundry.toml`: Foundry configuration file
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Write a Smart Contract

Let's create a simple smart contract to deploy to TAC.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a contract file">
    Replace the content of `src/Counter.sol` with our SimpleStorage contract:

    ```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 private value;
    address public owner;
    
    event ValueChanged(uint256 indexed oldValue, uint256 indexed newValue, address by);
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function setValue(uint256 newValue) public {
        uint256 oldValue = value;
        value = newValue;
        emit ValueChanged(oldValue, newValue, msg.sender);
    }
    
    function getValue() public view returns (uint256) {
        return value;
    }
}
```
</Step>
  <Step title="Create a deployment script">
    Create a new file in the `script` directory:

```bash
touch script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol
```

Add the following code to `script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

import "forge-std/Script.sol";
import "../src/Counter.sol";

contract DeploySimpleStorage is Script {
    function run() external {
        uint256 deployerPrivateKey = vm.envUint("PRIVATE_KEY");
        
        vm.startBroadcast(deployerPrivateKey);
        
        SimpleStorage simpleStorage = new SimpleStorage();
        
        console.log("SimpleStorage deployed to:", address(simpleStorage));
        
        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Configure Foundry for TAC
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a .env file for your private key">
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

    Add your private key to the .env file:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

<Warning>
  Never commit your .env file to version control. Add it to your .gitignore file.
</Warning>
</Step>
  <Step title="Update foundry.toml">
    Update the `foundry.toml` file to include the TAC network configurations:
```toml
[profile.default]
src = 'src'
out = 'out'
libs = ['lib']
solc = "0.8.17"

[rpc_endpoints]
tac_testnet = "https://turin.rpc.tac.build"

[etherscan]
tac_testnet = { key = "" }
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Step 5: Get Testnet TAC Tokens
Before deploying to the testnet, you'll need some TAC tokens to pay for gas fees.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Add TAC Testnet to your wallet">
    Add the TAC testnet to your MetaMask or other Ethereum wallet with the following details:

    - Network Name: TAC Turin Testnet
- RPC URL: https://turin.rpc.tac.build
- Chain ID: 2390
- Currency Symbol: TAC

</Step>
  <Step title="Get testnet tokens from the faucet">
    Visit the [TAC Testnet Faucet](https://turin.faucet.tac.build/) and follow these steps:

1. Connect your wallet
2. Enter your wallet address
3. Submit the request
4. Wait for the tokens to arrive in your wallet



</Step>
</Steps>
## Step 6: Compile the Contract
<Steps>
  <Step title="Compile the contracts">
    ```bash
    forge build
    ```
You should see output indicating successful compilation.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 7: Deploy the Contract to TAC Testnet
Now, let's deploy the contract to the TAC testnet.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Load environment variables">
    ```bash
    source .env
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy the contract">
    ```bash
    forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url tac_testnet --broadcast --verify
    ```

If you encounter issues with verification, you can deploy without it:

```bash
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url tac_testnet --broadcast
```

You should see output with the deployment transaction and contract address.

</Step>
  <Step title="Verify the deployment">
    You can verify your deployment by checking the TAC Turin Explorer:

1. Visit [TAC Turin Explorer](https://turin.explorer.tac.build/)
2. Search for your contract address
3. Confirm the contract details and transaction history
</Step>
</Steps>



## Step 8: Make Your Contract Accessible from TON
To make your contract accessible from TON wallets, you'll need to create a proxy contract. This is covered in detail in the Build a Proxy Contract guide, but here's a brief overview:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a proxy contract">
    Create a proxy contract that connects to your SimpleStorage contract and handles cross-chain messages from TON.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy the proxy contract">
    Deploy the proxy contract to the TAC EVM Layer using the same Foundry workflow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect with frontend">
    Use the TAC SDK to connect your frontend application to the proxy contract, enabling TON wallet interactions.
  </Step>
</Steps>
