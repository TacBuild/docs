Smart contracts are the backbone of your hybrid dApp on TAC. This guide will help you understand how to deploy and interact with Solidity contracts on TAC's EVM Layer.

<Note>
  TAC offers full EVM compatibility, allowing you to deploy your existing Solidity contracts without modifications.
</Note>

### Understanding Smart Contracts on TAC

TAC's smart contract environment consists of two key components:

- TAC EVM Layer: A fully EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain based on Cosmos SDK and Ethermint where your Solidity contracts are deployed.
- Proxy Contracts: Special contracts that receive and process messages from TON, acting as bridges between TON users and your EVM smart contracts.

### Development Workflow

When developing smart contracts for TAC, you'll follow this general workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write Solidity Contracts">
    Develop your smart contracts using Solidity, just as you would for Ethereum.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Locally">
    Use standard testing frameworks like Hardhat or Truffle to test your contracts locally.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy to TAC EVM">
    Deploy your contracts to the TAC EVM Layer using familiar deployment scripts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Proxy Contracts">
    Build proxy contracts that enable TON users to interact with your EVM contracts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Frontend">
    Use the TAC SDK to connect your frontend to both your EVM contracts and TON wallets.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Smart Contract Requirements

For optimal compatibility with the TON Adapter, your smart contracts should:

- Follow standard EVM security best practices
- Consider crosschain message timing in your contract logic
- Implement proper error handling for crosschain operations

### Proxy Contract Development

A critical part of developing for TAC is creating proxy contracts that enable communication between TON and your EVM contracts. Proxy contracts:

- Receive messages from TON users
- Process and validate input data
- Call your EVM contracts with the appropriate parameters
- Handle token transfers between chains
- Return results back to TON
