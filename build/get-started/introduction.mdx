Welcome to the TAC developer guides. If you're an EVM developer looking to expand your reach to TON's ecosystem and Telegram's 1 billion users, you're in the right place.

<Note>
  If you are using AI code editors like Cursor, we recommend adding our llm.txt
  (https://docs.tac.build/llm-full.txt) file to your code editor. This will
  provide your IDE with full context about TAC, enhancing your development
  experience.

## The Building Blocks of a TAC Application

Building a hybrid dApp on TAC involves two primary components:

  <Card

    href="/build/smart-contracts/introduction"
  >
    Deploy your existing Solidity contracts on TAC's EVM Layer
  </Card>
  <Card title="Frontend SDK" icon="browser" href="/build/sdk/introduction">
    Use our SDK to connect TON wallets to your EVM contracts
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How it Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deploy Your Smart Contracts">
    First, deploy your existing Solidity contracts on TAC's EVM Layer. You can
    use all the familiar tools like Hardhat, Truffle, or Remix.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build a Proxy Contract">
    TAC uses proxy contracts to route transactions between TON and your EVM
    contracts. You can build a custom proxy or use our templates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate the TAC SDK">
    Add the TAC SDK to your frontend to enable TON wallet connections and
    transaction routing through the TON Adapter.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch Your Hybrid dApp">
    With contracts deployed and frontend integrated, users can interact with
    your dApp directly from their TON wallets!
  </Step>
</Steps>

TAC is ideal for:

- Existing EVM projects wanting to reach Telegram's massive user base
