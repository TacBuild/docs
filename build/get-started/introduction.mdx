Welcome to the TAC developer guides. If you're an EVM developer looking to expand your reach to TON's ecosystem and Telegram's 1 billion users, you're in the right place.
<Note>
  This section is designed for developers who are already familiar with Solidity and JavaScript/TypeScript. If you're new to blockchain development, we recommend starting with the Learn section.

The Building Blocks of a TAC Application
Building a hybrid dApp on TAC involves two primary components:

  <Card title="Smart Contracts" icon="code" href="/developers/build/smart-contracts/introduction">
    Deploy your existing Solidity contracts on TAC's EVM Layer
  </Card>
  <Card title="Frontend SDK" icon="browser" href="/developers/build/sdk/introduction">
    Use our SDK to connect TON wallets to your EVM contracts
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How it Works
<Steps>
  <Step title="Deploy Your Smart Contracts">
    First, deploy your existing Solidity contracts on TAC's EVM Layer. You can use all the familiar tools like Hardhat, Truffle, or Remix.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build a Proxy Contract">
    TAC uses proxy contracts to route transactions between TON and your EVM contracts. You can build a custom proxy or use our templates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate the TAC SDK">
    Add the TAC SDK to your frontend to enable TON wallet connections and transaction routing through the TON Adapter.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch Your Hybrid dApp">
    With contracts deployed and frontend integrated, users can interact with your dApp directly from their TON wallets!
  </Step>
</Steps>
