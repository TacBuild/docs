<Steps>
  <Step title="Install create-tac-app">
    The fastest way to bootstrap a TAC project is using our CLI tool:

    ```bash

npx create-tac-app my-tac-project

````

This will create a new directory with a fully configured TAC project.
</Step>
  <Step title="Configure your environment">
    Make sure you have:

    - Node.js v14.16.0 or higher
- An Ethereum wallet with some testnet TAC tokens for deployment
- TON wallet for testing (Tonkeeper or TON Space recommended)

You can get testnet TAC tokens from the [TAC Testnet Faucet](https://turin.faucet.tac.build).
</Step>
  <Step title="Deploy contracts">
    Navigate to the contracts directory and deploy them to the TAC testnet:
```bash
cd my-tac-project/contracts
npm install
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network tacTestnet
````

<Warning>
  Make sure to include your ethereum `private key` environment variables in your
  `.env` file.
</Warning>
Take note of the deployed contract addresses displayed in the console: - SimpleMessage
contract address - MessageProxy contract address

</Step>
  <Step title="Update frontend configuration">
    Open `lib/contract_address.ts` in your project and update it with your deployed contract addresses:

```ts
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESSES = {
  simpleMessage: "0xYourSimpleMessageAddress",
  messageProxy: "0xYourMessageProxyAddress"
};
```

</Step>
  <Step title="Start the development server">
    Return to the project root and start the Next.js development server:

```bash
cd ..
npm run dev
```

Your TAC application is now running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

</Step>
  <Step title="Connect your TON wallet">
    Open your application in the browser and connect your TON wallet using the TON Connect button. The starter app includes a basic messaging example that demonstrates cross-chain communication from TON to EVM.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build your dApp">
    Now you can start building your hybrid dApp by:
- Modifying the smart contracts in the `contracts` directory
- Updating the frontend in the `pages` and `components` directories
- Leveraging the TAC SDK's cross-chain messaging capabilities

The starter app includes reusable components for TON wallet connection and TAC SDK integration.
