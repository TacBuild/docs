eOracle provides Dapps on TAC with secure, real-time data feeds critical for powering safe and capital-efficient lending markets. Built by experts in cybersecurity and risk management, and backed by $6B in staked security with 140 validators globally, eOracle is the most secure and decentralized oracle network available today.

## Why eOracle? 

eOracle leverages a decentralized, modular system designed specifically for high-stakes data delivery. Our network of 130+ validators, backed by over $2M in restaked ETH, ensures data integrity through real-time performance tracking and sophisticated outlier detection. Each price update flows through a transparent process where operators submit signed data to our proof-of-stake chain, achieving consensus before being cryptographically broadcast to target chains.

## ePrice – Modular Oracle for Asset Price Feeds**

ePrice is built on restaked Ethereum security and combines reliable infrastructure with sophisticated price discovery. It supports permissionless integration, enabling accurate and secure pricing for a wide range of assets, including low-liquidity and emerging markets.

## PT Token Pricing

PT tokens offer fixed yield with a known maturity value, making them attractive as collateral. However, they require precise pricing to avoid bad debt and ensure market efficiency. eOracle provides the Defi Ecosystem with secure PT token feeds that support safer borrowing, more accurate risk-adjusted rates, and better capital utilization—enabling PT-backed markets to scale reliably.

## RWAfi Feeds

eOracle supports real-world asset (RWAfi) markets with verified price feeds for tokenized off-chain financial instruments, such as treasuries. These feeds bridge the gap between traditional finance and DeFi, enabling safe use of RWAs as collateral. Accurate, secure pricing is essential to unlock the full potential of RWA-backed lending—and eOracle delivers exactly that.
