In this guide, we will deploy and interact with a smart contract on TAC EVM.

<Info>
  You can find the full code for this guide on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/TacBuild/example-dapps/tree/main/hello-world).
</Info>

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- NPM / Yarn
- Basic knowledge of Solidity
- An Ethereum wallet

## Set up your environment

The first thing we need to do is set up our environment. In this guide, we will use Foundry to compile and deploy our smart contract. Foundry is a modern development toolchain for Ethereum, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

### Install the Foundry CLI

To install the Foundry CLI, run the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

This will download foundryup. Then install Foundry by running,

```bash
foundryup
```

Once Foundry is installed, you can verify the installation by running `forge --version`.

### Initialize a Foundry project

Next, we need to initialize a Foundry project. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
forge init hello-world
```

Then, navigate inside counter_contract, and your project structure should look like this:

```
.
├── lib
├── script
├── src
└── test
foundry.toml
```

### Write your smart contract

Now, we need to write our smart contract. Create a file called `Hello.sol` in the `src` directory and add the following code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract HelloWorld {
    string private greeting = "Hello TAC!";

    event GreetingChanged(string newGreeting, address changedBy);

    function getGreeting() public view returns (string memory) {
        return greeting;
    }

    function setGreeting(string memory _newGreeting) public {
        greeting = _newGreeting;
        emit GreetingChanged(_newGreeting, msg.sender);
    }
}
```

The contract has two functions: `getGreeting` and `setGreeting`.

The `getGreeting` function returns the current greeting, and the `setGreeting` function sets a new greeting. The `GreetingChanged` event is emitted whenever the greeting is changed.

### Test your smart contract

To add tests for your smart contract, create a file called `Hello.t.sol` in the `test` directory and add the following code:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;


import {Test, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {HelloWorld} from "../src/Hello.sol";

contract HelloWorldTest is Test {
    HelloWorld public helloWorld;

    event GreetingChanged(string newGreeting, address changedBy);

    function setUp() public {
        helloWorld = new HelloWorld();
    }

    function test_InitialGreeting() public view {
        assertEq(helloWorld.getGreeting(), "Hello TAC!");
    }

    function test_SetGreeting() public {
        string memory newGreeting = "Hello from foundry!";

        vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
        emit GreetingChanged(newGreeting, address(this));

        helloWorld.setGreeting(newGreeting);
        assertEq(helloWorld.getGreeting(), newGreeting);
    }

    function testFuzz_SetGreeting(string memory randomGreeting) public {
        helloWorld.setGreeting(randomGreeting);
        assertEq(helloWorld.getGreeting(), randomGreeting);
    }


}
```

The above code is a test for our smart contract. It tests the initial greeting, the `setGreeting` function, and the `GreetingChanged` event.

### Compile your smart contract

Before we compile our smart contract, create a new script in the `script` directory called `hello.s.sol`, and add the following code:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import {Script, console} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {HelloWorld} from "../src/hello-tac.sol";

contract HelloWorldScript is Script {
    HelloWorld public helloWorld;

    function setUp() public {}

    function run() public {
        vm.startBroadcast();

        helloWorld = new HelloWorld();

        console.log("Initial greeting:", helloWorld.getGreeting());

        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```

Now, we can compile our smart contract by running the following command:

```bash
forge build
```

You should see compilation details such as:

```bash
[⠰] Compiling...
[⠘] Compiling 12 files with 0.8.15
[⠊] Solc 0.8.15 finished in 1.41s
Compiler run successful
```

### Deploy your smart contract

Before we deploy our smart contract, make sure to add TAC EVM as a network in your wallet, and get some testnet TAC. You can get testnet TAC from the [TAC Faucet](https://turin.faucet.tac.build/) and use the top right button to add TAC EVM as a network.

Next, To deploy your smart contract, run the following command:

You can replace `<your-rpc-url>` with: https://turin.rpc.tac.build

<Warning>
Make sure to replace `<your-private-key>` with your own Ethereum private key. Don't share or expose your private key.
</Warning>

```bash
forge script script/hello.s.sol:HelloWorldScript --rpc-url <your-rpc-url> --private-key <your-private-key>
```

You can view the deployed contract on the [TAC EVM Explorer](https://turin.explorer.tac.build/).

That is it! You have successfully deployed and interacted with a smart contract on TAC EVM.
