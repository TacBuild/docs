TAC JavaScript SDK facilitates cross-chain transactions from TVM (TON Virtual Machine) to EVM-compatible blockchains. It is designed to simplify cross-chain interactions for EVM developers by enabling transactions from TVM to EVM with minimal configuration.

This SDK allows EVM developers to perform cross-chain transactions without needing an in-depth understanding of TON. By specifying the following details, the SDK will generate the necessary transactions:

**For EVM:**

- The ProxyDapp address to interact with.
- The method to call on the contract.
- Any parameters required for the contract method.

**For TVM:**

- Addresses of TVM Jettons corresponding to EVM tokens.

Using these inputs, the SDK builds a TON transaction payload and enables further signature processing through TON-Connect or directly via mnemonic.

In future updates, the SDK will automatically calculate TON jetton addresses based on corresponding EVM tokens.
