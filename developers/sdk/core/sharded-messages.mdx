title: Sharded Messages
description: "Learn about sharded messages in TAC SDK"

Due to the specific architecture of TVM (TON Virtual Machine), it's not possible to send multiple tokens in a single transaction. The TAC-SDK uses a sharded messaging system to handle this limitation, where each token transfer is treated as a separate message.

## How It Works

Each message in the sharded system is linked on the validator side using a unique triplet:

- `caller`: The address initiating the transaction
- `ShardId`: Unique identifier for the message shard
- `ShardCount`: Total number of shards in the transaction

## Use Cases

### Single Token Transfer

For simple operations like token swaps:

- One token is transferred
- Single sharded message is created
- Message is processed individually

### Multiple Token Operations

For complex operations like liquidity providing:

- First token transfer is sent as one sharded message
- Second token transfer is sent as another sharded message
- Validators process and link these messages together using the unique triplet

### Example: Adding Liquidity

```typescript
// Example of providing liquidity with two tokens
const jettons: JettonOperationGeneralData[] = [
  {
    fromAddress: "tonUserAddress",
    tokenAddress: TVMtokenAAddress,
    jettonAmount: tokenAAmount,
    tonAmount: 0.4,
  },
  {
    fromAddress: "tonUserAddress",
    tokenAddress: TVMtokenBAddress,
    jettonAmount: tokenBAmount,
    tonAmount: 0.4,
  },
];
```

In this example:

- Each token transfer becomes a separate sharded message
- Both messages share the same caller and ShardCount
- Each message has a unique ShardId
- Validators link these messages together for the complete operation

### Message Processing

- Messages are generated separately for each token
- Each message contains:
  - Token transfer details
  - Unique shard identification
  - Link to the overall transaction
- Validators collect and process messages
- Messages are linked based on their unique triplet
- Complete operation is executed once all shards are processed
