The TAC-SDK provides comprehensive tools for tracking the status of cross-chain transactions through their entire lifecycle. This tracking system uses the TransactionStatus class to monitor transactions from initiation to completion.

## Getting Started

1. Operation ID
   First, obtain the `operationId` using the `transactionLinker` structure:

```typescript
const tracker = new TransactionStatus();
const operationId = await tracker.getOperationId(transactionLinker);
```

Note: If you receive an empty response string, it means validators haven't received your messages yet. Keep polling until you get a non-empty operationId.

2. Checking Transaction Status

Once you have the `operationId`, track the transaction status:

```typescript
const status = await tracker.getStatusTransaction(operationId);
```

## Transaction Status Lifecycle

1. EVM Message Collection
   - Status: EVMMerkleMessageCollected
   - Indicates validator has collected all events for a sharded message
   - For simple transfers, means the message is fully gathered
2. EVM Message Processing
   - Status: EVMMerkleRootSet
   - EVM message is added to the Merkle tree
   - Future roots will reflect this addition
3. EVM Execution
   - Status: EVMMerkleMessageExecuted
   - Message has been executed on the EVM side
4. TVM Message Collection
   - Status: TVMMerkleMessageCollected
   - Return message event is generated after EVM execution
   - Will be executed on the TVM side
5. TVM Message Processing
   - Status: TVMMerkleRootSet
   - TVM message is added to the Merkle tree
   - Future roots updated accordingly
6. TVM Execution
   - Status: TVMMerkleMessageExecuted
   - Final state: transaction completed its full cycle
   - Indicates successful cross-chain operation

## Simplified Status Tracking

For easier monitoring, use the simplified status method:

```typescript
const simplifiedStatus = await tracker.getSimpifiedTransactionStatus(
  transactionLinker
);
```

### Simplified Status Types

- Pending: Transaction is in progress
- Successful: Transaction completed successfully
- Failed: Transaction failed
- OperationIdNotFound: Operation ID not found

### Error Handling

Currently, there are no explicit error statuses. If an issue occurs:

- Transaction will pause at a particular stage
- Continue monitoring the status
- Check for timeout or other indicators
