- `startTracking` has been improved. Added optional parameters

### Removed

- `ExecutionStagesTableData` type
- `TrackingOperationResult` type

</Update>

<Update label="v0.5.1" description="2025-03-10">

### Changed

- The stage names have been changed
- Changed namings in enums
- OperationType added in the ExecutionStages
- ExecutionStages structure
- Added return value in method `sendShardTransaction` in `TonConnectSender`
- Added `forceSend` option in method `sendCrossChainTransaction` in `TacSdk`
- `startTracking` has been improved. Added optional parameters and return values

### Added

- `OperationType` type
- `ExecutionStagesTableData` type
- `TrackingOperationResult` type
- `StageName` enum
- `getOperationType` in `OperationTracker` retrieves the `OperationType` for `operationId`

### Removed

- Deleted `isBridgeOperation` (now it can be determined with `getOperationType`)

</Update>

<Update label="v0.5.0" description="2025-03-03">

### Changed

- Changed package name from `tac-sdk` to `@tonappchain/sdk`
- `calculateEVMTokenAddress` function now requires `tokenUtils` address as deployer and `crossChainLayer` address as constructor params
- Renamed `shardedId` -> `shardsKey`
- A `gasLimit` field has been added to `EvmProxyMsg` (defaulting to undefined, which will be set through simulation in this case)
- Renamed json properties in `buildEvmDataCell`
- Renamed urls in `OperationTracker`

### Added

- `options` parameter in `getSender` method to modify W5 and Highload V3 wallets
- `customLiteSequencerEndpoints` parameter in `SDKParams` to specify custom lite sequencer endpoints
- `simulateEVMMessage` method in `TacSdk` to simulate EVM message execution on TAC side

```
 async simulateEVMMessage(req: EVMSimulationRequest): Promise<EVMSimulationResults>
```

- `getOperationStatuses` method in `OperationTracker` retrieves the statuses of multiple operations based on their respective operationId's

- `getOperationIdsByShardsKeys` method in `OperationTracker` retrieves the operationId's based on their respective shardsKey's

- `getStageProfilings` method in `OperationTracker` retrieves the ExecutionStages's based on their respective operationId's

- `getStageProfiling` method in `OperationTracker` retrieves the ExecutionStages for operationId

- Added a pre-check before sending to the blockchain to ensure the transaction will execute successfully on the TAC side using the `simulateEVMMessage` method

- Support for highload V3 wallet as a sender

</Update>

<Update label="v0.4.2" description="2025-02-05">

### Changed

- `orbsOpener4` set as default in SDK

### Added

- Contract opener `orbsOpener4` that uses new version TON endpoints

</Update>

<Update label="v0.4.1" description="2025-02-05">
  ### Changed - `@tonappchain/artifacts` upgraded to `0.0.14`
</Update>

<Update label="v0.4.0" description="2025-02-03">
### Added
- `getUserJettonBalanceExtended` method in `TacSdk` to get user jetton balance extended with decimals info:

```typescript
async getUserJettonBalanceExtended(userAddress: string, tokenAddress: string): Promise<UserWalletBalanceExtended>
```

### Changed

- `AssetBridgingData` now supports multiple formats of asset value: with decimals and without decimals. In case decimals are not provided, the SDK will try to extract it from chain.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.3.7" description="2025-01-29">
### Added
- Section in readme about TACHeader
- AddLiquidity uniswap_v2 test
- `orbsOpener` method to construct custom contractOpener for TacSDK. It uses Orbs Network and does not have rate limits:

```typescript
export async function orbsOpener(network: Network): Promise<ContractOpener>;
```

### Changed

- SDK uses orbsOpener by default
- `address` field in `AssetBridgingData` can now accept either EVM or TVM address
- `SenderFactory.getSender` requires new parameter `network` when creating wallet wrapper using mnemonic
- Fixed `getContractState` in `liteClientOpener`
- Fixed all tests for TACHeader logic
- Version `@tonappchain/artifacts` upgraded to 0.0.12-addresses
- Request to `/status` endpoint of Sequencer API changed from GET to POST with body
- Signature of `getOperationStatus` is changed to:

```typescript
async getOperationStatus(operationId: string): Promise<StatusByOperationId>
```

### Removed

- `test bridgeData`

</Update>

<Update label="v0.3.6" description="2025-01-15">

### Added

- Custom TONParams and TACParams in SDKParams
- network and customLiteSequencerEndpoints params to OperationTracker constructor
- Static async function create in TacSdk for creating an instance of TacSdk
- Custom errors
- Methods that may construct custom contractOpener for TacSDK. Currently, it provides methods for Sandbox(without export from SDK) and LiteClient openers creation.

```typescript
export async function liteClientOpener(
  options: { liteservers: LiteServer[] } | { network: Network }
): Promise<ContractOpener>;

export function sandboxOpener(blockchain: Blockchain): ContractOpener;
```

- Method `closeConnections` in TacSdk for closing all network connections, e.g. to liteclients, if required
- Optional method `closeConnections` to `ContractOpener` interface which is called in `TacSdk.closeConnections` method

### Removed

- `init` function in `TacSdk`
- Public constructor of `TacSdk`

### Changed

- Calculate token addresses through emulation
- Renamed `TransactionStatus` to `OperationTracker`
- Renamed method `OperationTracker.getStatusTransaction()` to `OperationTracker.getOperationStatus()`
- Renamed method `OperationTracker.getSimpifiedTransactionStatus()` to `OperationTracker.getSimplifiedOperationStatus()`

- Changed struct of `SDKParams`
- Changed `ton-lite-client` library to its fork `@tonappchain/ton-lite-client`
