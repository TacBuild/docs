## Setting Up Your Telegram Wallet

Before you can use the TAC Testnet Faucet, you'll need to set up a Telegram native wallet. Here's how:

1. Open Telegram and search for `@wallet` in the search bar or use this direct link: [https://t.me/wallet](https://t.me/wallet)

2. You'll be redirected to a Telegram Mini App showing two wallet options: "Wallet" and "TON Space"

5. Once your wallet is set up, click on the three dots in the upper right corner to access **Settings**

## Using Your Testnet Tokens
